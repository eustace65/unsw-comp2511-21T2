# Project Management & Git Practices

This document outlines all of the project management and git practice details relevant to the project.

## Milestone 1 Timeline Planning

Using the user stories you have created and their story points, you will need to create an approximate timeline. **In this milestone, you will only need to plan for the completion of work in Milestones 1 and 2**.

For each week, create a list of objectives to achieve in that week, and state which team member is allocated to each objective.

* You can include notes such as team member availability in the plan and meeting times as well.
* Tasks only need to be broken down and delegated at the feature level, which you can ascertain from your user stories and acceptance criteria.
* You will need to consider both frontend and backend implementation when planning and delegating.

There are no strict guidelines for how this plan should be formatted or structured - it just needs to be understandable by your tutor.

Put your timeline in a file named `planning.pdf` in the root directory of this repository.

## Milestone 3 Timeline Planning

Similarly in Milestone 3, once you have updated your user stories with the new requirements and your chosen extension features, you will need to create a timeline for the remainder of the project.

## Milestones 2 and 3 - Git Practices

Throughout Milestones 2 and 3, you will be assessed on the following:

* Tasks are assigned to team members;
* Tasks are updated across the kanban columns;
* The board shows the truth of your team's progress;
* The timeline you created in Milestone 1 is updated as needed in Milestones 2 and 3
* Assignment of tasks in the timeline corresponds to the board;
* Detail and specificity in commit messages;
* Avoiding committing large chunks of code;
* Merge requests are approved by another team member;
* One feature = one branch = one merge request into `master`.

## All Milestones - Meeting Minutes

Throughout the project, you will need to keep a record of your meetings in the form of minutes.

* Minutes should contain a summary of what was discussed and action items.
* Your meeting minutes document needs to have evidence of version history - use a Google Doc or update a minutes doc/folder in your repo for this.
